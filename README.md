# Efficus: Project Management App

## Description

This web application is aimed for small teams who are looking for a simple software to help with their management and planning. It is a website built using the most well-known tech stack of JavaScript in 2024. It can greatly ease the work of many teams who are currently using paid and/or outdated softwares which do not deliver as much as the teams need. This website mainly divides its applications in four branches:

- **Users**: These are the clients using the website for their management needs. Any _user_ simply needs to register and join a _team_, and that's it! They can use all the services available in the software without any kind of payment or permission required. _Users_ can create _tasks_ in a _project_ and assign other _users_ in their _team_ to those _tasks_ as well.
- **Teams**: These are collections of different _users_ who are working as part of the same organization. Any _user_ can create a _team_, but other _users_ will have to join the _team_ voluntarily. The _user_ who creates the _team_ will be assigned as the Project Manager and they can assign another registered _user_ as the Product Owner as well. _Teams_ can have different groups with different members working on separate _projects_.
- **Projects**: These are the initiatives which a _team_ is working on using the software. New _projects_ can easily be created by different _users_ and members of the _team_ can be assigned to that _project_ so that they can start working on it. All _projects_ must have a title, an initial set of _tasks_ and a set of _users_ who will be working on that _project_. Additional details for the _project_ such as description, start date and end date can also be provided. _Projects_ can be seen in multiple views, including built-in Gantt charts, to ease the worflow of the _team_.
- **Tasks**: These are the individual units of each _project_ which can be assigned team members, priority, status, tags and points, along with the usual details like title, description, start date, due date, and attachments. These _tasks_ can be shifted between different time schedules and can easily be viewed and managed in different perspectives to analyze the _team's_ progress. Various statistics regarding the _team's_ _projects_ and _tasks_ are also generated automatically, which can also help with workflow management.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used with this project is possibly the most popular tech stack of JavaScript till now.
The frontend of the project has been built using **Next.js**, a full-stack framework of the **React** library. The designing of the project has been done using **TailwindCSS**, for the styling and **MaterialUI**, as the component library. **TypeScript** has been the primary programming language used in the project, because of its additional type safety and comaptibility with Next.js. **Redux Toolkit** has been used for global state management. The variety of graphs and charts have been created using **Chart.js**, an extremely diverse and easy-to-use JavaScript library created for this purpose only.
The backend for the project has been built using the **Node.js** environment, particularly with the **Express.js** framework, which allows for quick creation and operation of servers, routes and middleware. **PostgreSQL** database has been used for storing all of the data related to the software and **Prisma ORM** has been used for ensuring that all the stored data is validated and verified.

## Future Aim

The current plan is to deploy the website on Amazon Web Services\(which will be done very soon!\) and to continuously improve the software through user feedback. I also aim to add some more features to the project, which are planned and will be implemented very soon.
